# Dana and Jacob's Twitter ML Project!!

**Goal: classify the sentiment (mood) of tweets scraped from twitter**

## General TODO List

1. get familiar with twitter scraper library in python

2. gather data!! (we need LOTS of tweets)

3. Figure out how we will label the data

4. identify NLP libs to use in order to determine which features of these tweets we want to use to train/test our model. (this will require playing around with some NLP libraries!)

5. try out different classification models that have been trained on our data

6. choose the best classification model based on success metrics (accuracy, precision, sensitivity, etc.)

## Twitter Scraper in Python

We need a library that will allow us to pull thousands and thousands of tweets. We need a lot of data to train an accurate model! Here are some resources to help us figure that out, but we need to do some more research:
