# Dana and Jacob's Twitter ML Project!!

**Goal: classify the sentiment (mood) of tweets scraped from twitter**

## General TODO List

1. get familiar with twitter scraper library in python

2. gather data!! (we need LOTS of tweets)

3. identify NLP libs to use in order to determine which features of these tweets we want to use to train/test our model. (this will require playing around with some NLP libraries!)

4. try out different classification models that have been trained on our data

5. choose the best classification model based on success metrics (accuracy, precision, sensitivity, etc.)
